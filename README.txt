This code is for a prototype of a Spanish learning game
for kids. I used my knowledge of Spanish to create an array
of instances of the Questions class, gradually making the Questions
harder as they increase in index value. 

The game shows the player which answers are wrong by 
highlighting them in (styling is done with javascript), and the
correct answer is highlighted in green. 

The quiz is designed not to be able to move forward until
the player clicks on the right answer, so that they will
see where they went wrong.
