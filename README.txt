This code is for a prototype of a Spanish learning game
for kids. I used my experience as a Spanish teacher to create an array
of instances of the Questions class, gradually making the Questions
harder as they increase in index value. 

The game shows the player which answers are wrong by 
highlighting them in red (styling is done with javascript), and the
correct answer is highlighted in green. 

The quiz is designed not to let the user click on multiple answers in one
question, so that their score is not calculated incorrectly.
